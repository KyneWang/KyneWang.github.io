## Paper Acceptance in May 2024

Thrilled to share that our major research projects from last year have been accepted by VLDB, ACL, and KDD conferences! 

The PVLDB paper focuses on storage optimization for large-scale subgraph extraction; the ACL work leverages large language models to enhance graph inductive reasoning; and the KDD project achieves efficient contrastive learning on dynamic graphs. 

Many thanks to Prof. Luo and all our co-authors for their hard work and dedication! 

Welcome collaboration and feedback from our peers and look forward to further exploration in large-scale graph models and graph-enhanced LLMs.
